Q - What is Computer

A computer is an electronic device that can receive, process, and store data, and perform various operations based on a set of instructions (programs or software). The computer has become an essential tool in modern society, used for a wide range of tasks such as communication, entertainment, work, and education.

Q - What is RAM

RAM stands for Random Access Memory, which is a type of computer memory that is used to store data temporarily while the computer is running. The data stored in RAM can be quickly accessed and manipulated by the computer's central processing unit (CPU), making it an important component for ensuring fast and efficient performance. Unlike permanent storage devices like hard drives, the contents of RAM are lost when the computer is turned off.

Q - Where is data store in a computer?

Data in a computer can be stored in several different places, including:
RAM (Random Access Memory): Data is temporarily stored in RAM while the computer is running and can be quickly accessed by the CPU.
Hard Disk Drive (HDD): Data can be stored on a permanent basis on a hard drive, which is a spinning disk that stores data on magnetic surfaces.
Solid State Drive (SSD): Similar to an HDD, an SSD is a type of permanent storage device that stores data on flash memory chips, offering faster data access times and improved durability compared to HDDs.
Optical Drives: CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs can be used to store data, although these drives are becoming less common as more data is stored digitally.
External Storage Devices: Data can also be stored on external devices such as USB flash drives, external hard drives, and memory cards.
The type of storage used will depend on factors such as the amount of data, the required speed of access, and the need for portability.

Q - What is that input device used to type text and numGers on a document in the computer system?

The input device used to type text and numbers on a document in a computer system is usually a keyboard. Keyboards are connected to the computer either through a wired connection or wirelessly and allow the user to input text, numbers, and various other characters into the computer. Other input devices such as touchscreens, pointing devices (e.g. mouse), and digital pens can also be used to enter text and numbers, but the keyboard is the most commonly used input device for typing text and numbers on a computer.

Q - What are the output devices?

Output devices are components of a computer system that allow it to present information to the user. Some common output devices include:
Monitor: A display screen that shows text, images, and videos generated by the computer.
Printer: A device that prints text and images on physical paper.
Speaker: An output device that plays audio generated by the computer.
Projector: A device that projects images and videos onto a large screen or wall.
Headphones: An output device that plays audio directly into the user's ears.
Plotter: A specialized printer that produces large-format, high-quality graphics and technical drawings.
Braille Display: A device that converts text into raised dots that can be felt by visually impaired users.
The type of output device used will depend on the user's needs and the type of information being presented by the computer.

Q - Which is the input device that alloEs a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen?

The input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen is called a pointing device. The most common pointing device is a mouse, which is a small device that is rolled on a flat surface to move the cursor. Other pointing devices include touchpads, trackballs, and stylus pens for touchscreens. These devices allow the user to control the movement of the cursor on the screen and interact with graphical elements such as icons, buttons, and menus.

Q - Which language is directly understood Gy the computer Eithout a translation program?

Computers understand instructions and data in the form of machine language, also known as machine code or assembly language. This is a low-level language that consists of binary code, or a series of ones and zeros, that can be directly executed by the computer's central processing unit (CPU). Machine language is the only language that a computer can understand without the need for a translation program, as it provides a direct mapping of instructions to the hardware components of the computer.
While machine language is difficult for humans to read and write, high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++ have been developed to make it easier for programmers to write code that is executed by computers. These high-level languages are translated into machine code by compiler or interpreter programs, allowing the computer to execute the instructions.

Q - What are Input devices?

Input devices are components of a computer system that allow the user to enter data and commands into the computer. Some common input devices include:
Keyboard: A device with buttons that allow the user to type text and numbers into the computer.
Mouse: A pointing device used to move the cursor on the screen and interact with graphical elements.
Touchpad: A flat surface that senses the movement of a user's finger and moves the cursor accordingly.
Touchscreen: A display screen that can also function as an input device, allowing the user to interact with the computer by touching the screen.
Trackball: A pointing device that consists of a ball that is rotated to move the cursor on the screen.
Joystick: An input device used for gaming or controlling specific software applications.
Scanner: A device that reads and converts physical documents into digital form.
Microphone: An input device used to record audio and voice commands.
The choice of input device will depend on the type of data being entered and the user's personal preference.
